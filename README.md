this link for website by vercel:

when you with your friends or family members do multiple expense then it is very hard to decide how much each member owes or owed .
To split your expenses this website will help you.
You have to just enter the information expense name ,who paid?,how much paid? and the involved members and it will split it.

Feature of this website are:

2.it stores data in local storage so that you will not lose data if you refresh website.

4.It will handle basic errors like if you are trying to add member which is already present it will not add it again.
