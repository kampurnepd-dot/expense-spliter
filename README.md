this link for website by vercel:

when you with your friends or family members do multiple expense then it is very hard to decide how much each member owes or owed .
To split your expenses this website will help you.
You have to just enter the information expense name ,who paid?,how much paid? and the involved members and it will split it.
I implemented  features like Member management,DOM,logic for expense spliter and local storage.
Feature of this website are:
1.It shows net balance of data related to expense means expense name , paid money and number of members involved and at last net balance of each member.
2.it stores data in local storage so that you will not lose data if you refresh website.
